🔷** Rock vs Mine Sonar Prediction** 🔷


📡 Sonar-based object classification: This project uses Logistic Regression to classify whether a sonar signal reflects off a rock 🪨 or a mine ⚓.

📌**Project Objective**
The goal of this project is to predict whether an underwater object detected by sonar signals is a rock or a mine (metallic object). This is crucial for submarine navigation, naval defense, and underwater object detection.

We use machine learning (Logistic Regression) to classify the sonar signals based on frequency patterns.

📂 **Dataset Information**
📊 The dataset used for this project is the Sonar Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
Each row contains 60 frequency-based features extracted from sonar signals. The last column indicates:
✅ Rock 🪨 → Label: "R"
✅ Mine ⚓ → Label: "M"

🛠️ **Tech Stack**
🚀 Libraries Used:
✔️ pandas – Data handling
✔️ numpy – Numerical operations
✔️ sklearn – Machine Learning models & evaluation

📌 Algorithm Used:
✔️ Logistic Regression – A classification algorithm that predicts the probability of an object being a rock or a mine.
